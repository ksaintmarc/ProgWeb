                            The truth is I’m a computer science student trying to succeed. <br>
                            I draw globally since very small and it’s always remained a hobby. <br>
                            I started drawing on tablet graphics in the summer of 2020 and I use an XP-Pen Artist 15.6 Pro and Krita software.
                            I mainly make fanarts of video games or manga but also original drawings.'
